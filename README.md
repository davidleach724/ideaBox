# Idea Box

### Summary
The Idea Box website gives users a place to create, store, and favorite the ideas that pop into their heads.

### How It Works
- Users start by entering a title for their idea in the title input and the body of their idea in the body field
- Upon clicking the save button the user's custom idea card is added to the space below the input area
- If the user decides they don't like the idea they created they can delete it by clicking on the card's X
- If the user really likes a particular idea they can favorite their idea by clicking the card's star. If they change their mind they can unfavorite.
- In addition to seeing the star change color to red to show it is a favorite, in the right-hand panel the user can click the "Show Starred Ideas" button to narrow down their view to just their favorite ideas. In this view the user can still unfavorite cards by clicking on the stars if they decide that upon comparing an idea to the other favorites it doesn't quite make the cut.
- To return to all ideas the user simply clicks on the same button that now has the updated text "Show All Ideas"
- Since you don't want your good ideas to vanish when you close the tab the users can close their tab or end their session and be confident that the next time they return to the site their ideas will still be there
